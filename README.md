Task- Feedback widget.

- Your task is to create an application for collecting statistics. There are
  only three options for feedback: good, neutral and bad.

- The application should display the number of reviews collected for each
  category. The application should not store feedback statistics between
  different sessions (page refreshes).

- Expand the functionality of the application so that the interface displays
  more statistics about the collected feedback. Add a display of the total
  number of collected reviews from all categories and the percentage of positive
  reviews.

- Extend the functionality of the application so that the statistics block is
  rendered only after at least one feedback has been collected. Report the lack
  of statistics to the <Notification message="There is no feedback"> component.
